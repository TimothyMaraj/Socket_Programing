# CS4310.  Socket Programing #1

### Description 

* In this assignment, you will develop a simple socket-based TCP program in Python or C++. 
* Create a server that accepts lines of input from a client and prints the lines onto the serverâ€™s standard output. (You can do this by modifying the TCPServer.py program in the text.) 

* Compile and execute your program. On any other machine
that contains a Web browser, set the proxy server in the browser to the host that is running your server program; also configure the port number appropriately.

* Your browser should now send its GET request messages to your server, and your server should display the messages on its standard output.

* Use this platform to determine whether your browser generates conditional GETmessages for objects that are locally cached.
